Overview
--------
This is the packaging of the CollabNet TeamForge (CTF) Integration Server.  It
includes everything to build and run the software that would allow you to
configure a CTF server to use the system running the software as an SCM
integration server.

Notes
-----
As of right now, the following directories are pulled in from the CTF source
base and SHOULD NOT be modified unless you want to change the corresponding
sources in CTF:

* installer/integration-scripts
* installer/viewvc

CSVN
----
Currently we are building web applications for a standalone CTF integration
server and a specialized CSVN integration server.  Any CSVN-specific work
should be done in csvn-webapp.

Running
-------
The only place that "running" the application makes sense at this point is to
run a remote SCM integration server for CTF.  To do this, follow these steps:

* mvn clean package -Denvironment=development -Dctf.hostname=<CTF_HOSTNAME>
* cd ctf-webapp
* sudo httpd -f `pwd`/target/sourceforge_home/conf/httpd.conf -k start
* mvn jetty:run-exploded

Stopping
--------
Stopping is as simple as CTRL-C in the window Jetty is running in and then
running the following:

* sudo httpd -f `pwd`/target/sourceforge_home/conf/httpd.conf -k stop

Packaging
---------
To package the available artifacts, which at this time are CollabNet
Subversion (CSVN) specific, run the following:

* mvn clean install assembly:assembly

At this point, you should have the following "packages":

* csvn-webapp/target/integration.war: The CSVN-specific CTF integration
   server web application
* target/integration-scripts.zip: The CSVN-specific CTF integration server
   scripts

Status
------
As progress on this project is made, this file will be updated to reflect
not only the state of the project but how to use it and its built artifacts.
